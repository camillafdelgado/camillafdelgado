- 👋 Hi, I’m Camilla Delgado. I have a bachelor's degree in marketing and advertising from Brazil. I'm currently transitioning into UX Design.
- 👀 I’m interested in optimizing my front-end programming skills to help me broaden my opportunities as an aspiring UX Designer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and would like to learn back-end at some point.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development and mobile apps.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I speak four languages! I went to Brazil knowing nothing about portuguese and had to learn in 3 months lol. Aside from that, I also speak spanish, english, and french.
